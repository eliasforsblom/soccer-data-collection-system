### Project Document: Phase 1 - Initial Planning and Research

#### **1. Project Goals**
- To develop a complete system for collecting soccer data from online TV broadcasts.
- The system will utilize deep learning, specifically image recognition, to extract relevant data.
- Focus on creating a robust data collection model with a secondary goal of implementing a simple, user-friendly GUI.

#### **2. Project Scope**
- **Inclusions**:
  - Collecting and processing TV broadcast video data.
  - Developing a machine learning model for extracting data (e.g., player positions, ball movements, game events).
  - Building a lightweight GUI for data extraction and visualization.
  - Storing and organizing extracted data for further analysis.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Advanced GUI features beyond basic usability.
  - Handling live-streaming integration in the initial version.

#### **3. Requirements**
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Python as the primary development language.
  - Use of pre-trained ultralytics YOLOv-models for object detection.
  - Hardware capable of running deep learning models efficiently (e.g., GPU-enabled system).
- **Data Requirements**:
  - Access to soccer game broadcasts (e.g., recorded streams, available datasets).
  - Annotated data for fine-tuning YOLOv models if necessary.

#### **4. Research Objectives**
- Identify tools and libraries for:
  - Processing and handling video streams (e.g., OpenCV, FFmpeg).
  - Fine-tuning YOLOv models for soccer-specific tasks.
  - Data storage and management (e.g., SQL databases, pandas).
- Explore existing datasets or resources for training and validation.
- Understand potential challenges in extracting soccer-specific data from TV broadcasts (e.g., camera angles, occlusions).

#### **5. Deliverables**
- A finalized project document outlining all objectives, scope, and requirements.
- A research report on:
  - Available tools and technologies for video processing and deep learning.
  - Methods for fine-tuning YOLOv models for sports analytics.
  - Challenges and mitigation strategies for data extraction from broadcasts.
- A list of hardware and software tools to acquire or install.

#### **6. Timeline**
- **Week 1**: Define project goals and scope; research video processing tools.
- **Week 2**: Investigate YOLOv model customization; compile hardware/software requirements.
- **Week 3**: Summarize findings and finalize deliverables.

#### **7. Potential Risks**
- Difficulty in acquiring suitable video broadcast data for training and testing.
- Challenges in fine-tuning YOLOv models to handle complex soccer scenarios.
- Hardware limitations affecting model training and performance.

#### **8. Next Steps**
1. Assign specific tasks for research and documentation.
2. Acquire initial tools and resources for testing.
3. Begin drafting the research report based on findings.
